('REV001','9/8/2021','4','Latao probably has the most variety of ingredients I''ve 
ever seen in AYCE hot pot restaurants. They have all the ingredients that I'' ve �
never seen in any hot pot places I went to before and that''s the part that 
attracts me. We ordered the Benz pot with Szechuan hot spicy broth, tomato with ox-
tail broth, and the herb broth. All of them were yummy except the tomato flavor 
could be stronger. But I''m satisfied because the broth is way better than urban''s
haha. However, several items were not available when we order them. My sister 
ordered several interesting ingredients to try out but they told us it''s not 
available today and it''s kind of annoying since that''s the main reason we went 
there. The majority of the ingredients weren''t available and that''s one of the 
main cons. (-1)
CONS:
1. The sauce area was surrounded by mosquitoes but they covered the sauces so I 
don''t think it''s a big issue.
2. They don''t use the iPad as an ordering tool so it''s not as convenient as 
urban. Urban''s system makes it much easier to order. You have to tell them what 
you want and they''ll give you one portion (not a lot) unless you tell them how 
many portions you want.
3. Ingredients might be out.
PROS:
1. Great broth
2. Variety of ingredients to choose from, such as Angus beef steak, black pork, 
Angus beef brisket, and many more,
3. Customer service was great.
3. Despite of not having iPad, the servers were attentive and checks on us 
constantly for food ordering.
Overall, I would recommend it to locals that wanted hot pot. Oh, and they offer a 
discount for paying in cash.','RST001','USR001','WEB001'),

I both agreed, the concept is fun! Love, love, love the decor (Sorry no entrace 
pics...will take next time), especially the ceiling.
Employees had patience w/us. Answered all of our questions & provided 
recommendations (all were good).
Of the 3 broths we chose, layered w/flavor & a hint of spiciness, the tomato was my
favorite! The tom yum was well balanced & flavorful as well. We also agreed, we 
could enjoy all of the broths w/o any add-ins on a cold winter''s day or when 
we''re not feeling our best.
Herbs, seasonings & sauces are located @ the bar in the rear of the restaurant.
We ordered 2 kinds of mushrooms, red snapper, head on shrimp, pork balls, broccoli,
ramen, vermicelli, angus beef, pork belly, fatty beef & other items that have 
slipped my memory.
Located @ The Enclave. Follow the signs to garage parking.

The restaurant staff are very friendly especially the front desk ""guy""- very 
accommodating.
This is all Hot Pot with Appetizers included In price. Can  add Sushi for an 
additional price. Weekends are dinner prices.
We shared various choices and they do offer a few different broths to choose from. 
The food came out fairly quickly and they were very attentive.
In the back of the restaurant they have sauces, herbs, garlic to add flavor to you

I chose the Tum Yum broth which has a lot of flavor and isn''t oily. The spicy 
broth has too much oil. My favorite was the lamb and ribeye. I think they aren''t 
crazy exceptional but do offer a good fresh variety and reasonably

this new College Park location is quickly earning it''s familial reputation.
Now, hot pot is really hot right now? All puns intended.
But what''s even hotter is mixing hot pot with something else.
For instance:
KPot in Rockville which features hot pot and kbbq at the same table.
or
Friendship BBQ which will feature hot pot and things cooked on skewers.
And now, we have L Tao; which is all about both hot pot and sushi. Yes... I know, �
hold onto your pantaloons.
Not only that, You get the all you can eat hot pot for 24 dollars at dinner, and 
add on all you can eat sushi for 3 more dollars.
I literally asked the waiter incredulously if this was really a thing. Nah, 
there''s no way possible you can add on an all you can eat sushi option for 3 
dollars. I''m not in heaven yet. Or am I? Then after he insisted that this was 
really I thing, I expected him to point me to a page where the sushi options for 
the All You Can Eat sushi was like 5 options and they all have no real fish. Nope! 
He''s like... basically, you can get any of these sushi options on this whole page.
*Jaw Dropping*.
So obviously I ordered both.
The hot pot was what really impressed me. The selection was awesome. Most of the 
veg and meats were fresh. They make their own fish balls! And other balls! I know, 
right!?
We got the
-Tom Yum Broth
- Tomato Brosh
- Mixed Mushroom Broth
The mixed mushroom broth was a bit bland, but the other two broths were definitely 
winners.
And the most surprising thing of this visit; I realized that if I had to rank hot 
pot and sushi on the favorite foods list- sushi would come in lower than hot pot. I
just could not stop focusing on the hot pot. I ordered some tuna/yellowtail/ and 
salmon sashimi which was quite good. But I really probably could have done without 
the sushi. I know!? Crazy right?!

The first time I came I ordered their 2 roll lunch special. My friend got the 3 
roll lunch special and she couldn''t even finish it. We were both surprised how 
full we were from these rolls. They are definitely smaller than a normal roll but 
for about $11, you can''t beat it. I got the salad on the side and their dressing 
was so delicious. It was a sweet ginger dressing and I wish I could have the recipe
because I would love to make it at home.
The next time I went I got the honey sesame chicken lunch special. I wouldn''t say 
it really tastes like honey or sesame, but it mostly kind of just tastes like 
orange chicken. Personally I really liked it and it was good enough for two meals 
(there was a ton more chicken under my rice). That whole platter was only $8 so 
again, such a great place to get bang for your buck.

Eats to place an order here.  Both times our food arrived within about an hour.  A 
couple weeks ago I bought a Taiwanese cookbook so wanted to compare the taste of 
homemade fried chicken bites (yan su ji) with a restaurant.  I used an air fryer 
but assumed Taiwanese restaurants would use traditional methods of oil in a wok or 
some sort of deep fryer.  The crispy chicken as well as the fried squid from Jumbo 
Jumbo were pretty tasty.  I also enjoyed the oriental ground pork noodles.  
Personally I''m not a huge fan of dry bean curd but it reminded me of my parents'' 
home cooking and it was nice to have rice as a texture contrast with the rest of 
the meal.
Other Taiwanese places do have fancier offerings and presentation of bubble tea but
Jumbo''s simple mango milk tea still tasted good.  The tapioca pearls were 
pleasantly ''Q'' (having the Taiwanese prized ''Al Dente'' texture).  Will continue

devouring my meal here! (One day I''ll make it!) there are a number of fantastic 
items here, and a couple that could use improvement from my perspective. However, 
that doesn''t keep me from ordering here weekly to every other week!
I''ve been dining here since college, and still have yet to find Taiwanese chicken 
as good. It is dark meat so it is tender, flavorful, and stays crispy. It even 
reheats to a crisp perfection if you refrigerate it to keep leftovers. The 
seasoning is addictive and can go on nearly anything. However, the combo with 
ground pork and rice is a decent deal money wise, but doesn''t taste great. The 
ground pork doesn''t seem seasoned whatsoever. Honestly, I really just wanted the 
rice anyway.
The spiced salt tofu and seasoned fries are also spectacular. With delivery, they 
can become soft. But usually when you order for pickup they try to package it so it
doesn''t get soft or soggy.
The spicy pork lo mein had much more savory/saltiness flavor years ago. I still 
order it, but so add salt myself for the balance. It''s very spicy and can be 
overwhelming, so the salt used to offer a good balance where you can still taste 
the other flavors. The pork itself seems to have become lower quality over the 
years (maybe it''s just me). However, I still love this dish enough to sprinkle my 
own salt or pick out the pork if necessary.
The bubble tea is great, nothing special. However, it''s super convenient for 
students and the community on campus. It''s also a perfect add with the food.
Even with some of my picky notes about missing salt and iffy flavored pork (other 
than the chicken) I remain obsessed with the food. Highly

since Looney''s is probably one of my highest check-in places!
Looney''s Pub at College Park was our go-to bar. With friendly bartenders, a 
plethora of drink options, and absolutely amazing food they were always delightful 
to visit for our regular Tues night trivia, to catch a game on one of the many 
sports channel tvs, or get in some other random event!
But let me focus on the food. Looney''s is one of those interesting places where 
you want to try the entire menu, but then again you love your regular dishes SOO 
SOO MUCH it''s so hard to order something else (even if it will turn out 
delicious).
The food is not greasy bar food; it is homemade, scratch to table, well-cooked 
deliciousness.
The fries are on my top three fries favorite list!
My typical go-to dishes are:
Crabby Patty -a delicious burger topped with creamy crab meat and cheese. The pack 
on the toppings so there is usually plenty of dip dripping along the sides to eat 
with your fries
Seafood Quesadilla-hearty..very hearty pieces of shrimp & crab melted with a few 
blends of cheese inside a large flour tortilla, paired with fresh jalapenos and the
best salsa
Wings-doesn''t matter which sauce you chose the wings are always big, juicy, well-
crisped on the outside with moist warm chicken inside
Seafood Bay Bridge Club-what an amazing unique dish...a club sandwich layered with 
shrimp salad, a crabcake, bacon, and veggies. The shrimp salad has a delectable 
sauce-smothering the bread creating moist bites-the crabcake is hearty with fresh 
chunks of crab not too much filler-the bacon is always cooked to bacon happiness 
perfection-and fresh tomato, lettuce, and onions to pair
Crab Pretzel-a large pretzel-cooked perfectly (soft pretzels are one of my favorite
foods, theirs is beyond yum-azing), then topped with creamy crab meat yes please.
Again, I want to explore the entire Looney''s menu-I have dabbled in some other 
dishes, I''ve never had a bad dish, but man I crave these go-tos so they are my 
must order! We even most times order two entrees each to have lunch for the next

When I first called the man who answered and said ""there''s a 30 min wait on 
chicken"" . First of all you close in 30 mins AND all you sell is chicken so 
that''s suspect af. Seems like they didn''t want to do their job .
I ordered TWO Natas and a brownie for pick up. After checking my bag there was only
ONE nata and they were cold to the touch. I''ve never received natas cold!
The guy took my natas and brownie back and the other lady at the front acted 
confused. I had to explain THREE times and she still didn''t understand! She said 
the brownies came cold...fine! But I paid for TWO natas and only received ONE order
and it was COLD. They gave me a ""warmer"" one and I was standing waiting for my 
other and she was confused as to why! I explained AGAIN that I had gave back my 
complete order for the correct order.
She gave me a brownie and NOT ANOTHER NATA SO I HAD TO EXPLAIN AGAIN!!!! They ended
up giving me another cold NATA .
I will NEVER return to this Nandos again and I need to speak with the manager 
because this was completely unacceptable and now im here warming up my Natas

So today I decided let''s try something different.... Something I haven''t had in a
while.. somewhere New to me
The Resturant was clean... Bright and inviting
Ordering was simple...I asked a few questions to make a finial decision
Ordered the Gyro platter and Gyro French fry platter
Really good choices
Recommend both items.... Especially the fry platter for a drunken 
night','RST011','USR031','WEB001'),

absolutely loves this place. Me on the other hand....I think it''s pretty average. 
Whoops I sound like a snob. But I have had sushi at many other places and the rolls
here just don''t compare. Although the order that I had last time around was super 
yummy. Sorry I forgot what it was called  We also ordered the fried cheesecake and 
it was delicious! Great way to end a sushi date hehe.','RST012','USR032','WEB001'),

serve, absolutely yummy. Sushi is good but I feel for the price I pay, I should get
more food.','RST012','USR033','WEB001'),
('REV041','3/25/2015','3','There''s nothing much spectacular about its sushi, I 
come here once in a while when I crave for sushi since there is not much choice 
around College Park. Better than never, I appreciate this place for now.
PS: Waiters are extremely serious? I feel sorry to talk when I order. Maybe the 
problem is me, no clue?

('REV042','9/14/2021','5','Lovely place and delicious food. Very entertaining to 
cook the food yourself, mix the sauces and experiment. The staff is very friendly 
and quick. They also have karaoke rooms, in case you love to sing and want to spend
couple of hours singing with your friends for an additional charge. They have 
discounts 12-4pm for karaoke rooms. Highly recommend.

ordered a beef bento box and chicken drunken noodles. the drunken noodles did not 
taste like how they were supposed to at all. they were definitely spicy but besides
that there was no flavor and especially no basil flavor which is what drunken 
noodle is known for. the beef bento box was average but nothing special. i wouldn t�
come back here. the taro bubble tea with tapioca was good but not 
cold.','RST003','USR037','WEB002'),

('REV046','10/14/2021','5','Best specialty roll I ever had. Particularly the 
Rockville Roll. The other rolls are fresh but ok. I usually don t go for specialty �
rolls as you can get a better sense of quality fish from regular rolls and sashimi 
but in this case, you are definitely getting a winner with the specialty roll. Glad
I found this.','RST005','USR039','WEB002'),
